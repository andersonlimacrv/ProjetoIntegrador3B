# Projeto_Integrador_3B

## Project Description

This project aims to apply the knowledge acquired in Object Oriented Programming and Development for Mobile Devices to develop web applications that address real demands and propose improvements and new strategies in the data storage system of Instituto de Menores Dom Antônio Zattera.

### Technologies Used

The following technologies will be utilized to achieve the proposed objective:

- **PHP**: PHP will be used to develop the system's business logic, process requests, and interact with the data storage system.
- **HTML**: HTML will be used for structuring the web pages and presenting the content to the users.
- **CSS**: CSS will be used for styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript will be employed to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.

### Data Storage System

To handle the data storage operations, we have chosen **SQLite** as the database management system. SQLite is a lightweight, embedded, and easy-to-handle relational database that offers the necessary functionality for record creation, reading, updating, and deletion operations. Its inclusion within the project itself simplifies the setup and maintenance processes.

By leveraging the capabilities of these technologies, we aim to create a robust and efficient web application that meets the specific needs of Instituto de Menores Dom Antônio Zattera and contributes to improving their data storage system.

Please refer to the [documentation](doc/) for detailed information on how to set up and use the application.
